### Questions 1

### Executive Summary

Google Ads has proven to be the most effective channel for user acquisition based on the analytics; however, the difference in performance compared to other acquisition channels is relatively small. Among all the countries analyzed, Rwanda recorded the highest number of user activations, though the margin compared to other countries is modest.
The current overall activation rate is 67.6%, indicating that nearly one-third of validated users do not proceed to complete a transaction. Specifically, 32.4% of users who were approved or validated did not perform any transactions within the first 30 days after registration.
Analysis of the onboarding process reveals that a user’s verification level plays a significant role in determining both the likelihood of activation and the average number of days it takes to become active.

### Methodology 

* SQL queries and DAX measures were developed to facilitate the analysis. In the absence of official exchange rate data to USD within the dataset, local destination currencies were converted using historical exchange rates sourced through online research, aligned with the specific timeframes of the transactions.


* The effectiveness of the onboarding funnel is evaluated based on conversion thresholds: a rate below 50% indicates a weak funnel that requires substantial improvement; a rate between 50% and 70% reflects moderate performance with room for optimization; while a rate approaching 100% signifies a strong and well-functioning onboarding process.

### Business Insights

*	Activation rates and transaction volumes—both critical to revenue growth—can be improved by introducing volume-based discounts. Offering incentives tied to higher transaction amounts or frequencies can encourage user engagement, drive repeat usage, and ultimately increase overall revenue.

*	Enhancing the verification experience can significantly improve activation rates by reducing friction for users. A smoother, faster verification process also helps shorten the overall onboarding time, enabling users to engage with the product more quickly and effectively.


### Next Steps


* A targeted survey should be conducted to uncover additional reasons aside why verified users fail to complete activation within 30 days of registration. Understanding these underlying factors will enable the development of more effective strategies to improve activation rates.

### Questions 2


### Executive Summary

Based on the findings, the user segment classified as regular—defined as individuals with five or more transactions—generates the highest revenue, accounting for 52.8% of the total share. Furthermore, analysis indicates that the 18 to 24 age group has the highest number of activations, contributing approximately 50% of the total, surpassing the 25–34 and 35–44 age groups. Transaction volumes peaked in January and March 2024, primarily driven by payment cycles common among freelancers and independent professionals, including year-end invoice settlements, new project initiations, and quarterly billing periods. 

### Methodology 

*	Transaction volumes were categorized into three groups for analytical clarity: users with one or fewer transactions were classified as “Occasional”, those with five or more transactions as “Regular”, and users with ten or more transactions as “High Value” customers. This segmentation helps in understanding user engagement and revenue contribution patterns more effectively.

### Business Insights


* Implementing volume-based discounts encourages individuals to perform more transactions, which in turn strengthens customer retention by promoting higher engagement and fostering long-term loyalty.


* Targeting the 18 to 24 age group is expected to significantly boost user acquisition, as this demographic has shown the highest activation rates and engagement levels. Concentrating efforts on this segment can help maximize growth potential.

### Next Steps

*	Focus marketing efforts on channels predominantly used by the 18 to 24 age group to effectively increase user acquisition within this key demographic.






### Executive Summary 

Based on the analysis, Uganda and Ghana emerge as key markets to prioritize for expansion. In Uganda, efforts to increase user activation are likely to result in a substantial growth in transaction volumes. Meanwhile, Ghana shows significant potential for growth, as it already records considerable transaction volumes but has a comparatively low user activation rate—indicating that improving activation processes could unlock untapped revenue opportunities.

### Business Insights: 

* Targeted promotional campaigns should be implemented in Ghana and Uganda to drive higher user activation and capitalize on growth opportunities in these markets.

### Next Steps: 

* Comprehensive survey activities should be undertaken in Tanzania and South Africa to thoroughly investigate and identify the root causes of their underperformance. This will enable targeted interventions to improve outcomes in these markets.

*	Targeted promotional campaigns should be strategically designed and implemented in Ghana and Uganda to increase user activation rates. By focusing on these markets’ specific needs and behaviors, these initiatives can effectively unlock growth opportunities and drive higher transaction volumes.
